      <p>I had the idea of staying up-to-date with news and other things in one place, and be selective about it. You get exactly the category of news you want.</p>
      <p>When I was searching for APIs I could use, I saw NewsAPI.org and knew my project was ready to be launched. So I started a brainstorming session about it and Zulgrad was born.</p>
      <p>In the future I hope to add multiple useful APIs, the next one is from CoinMarketCap to stay up-to-date with your favorites cryptocurrencies and their prices.</p>
